# Project: brainf_interpreter_in_ocaml
An interpreter for the Brainf\*ck esoteric programming language written in entirely in OCaml.

# Background
[Brainf\*ck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) was invented in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller and consists of only 8 symbols. The goal of this project is to provide an interpreter for this language written purely in OCaml.

# Setup
Simply pull down this repo and follow these steps:
1. In the project directory goto ./src
2. Type `make all` and hit enter
3. To run a program, type `./bfi <Filename>`

This code should work with OCaml 4.05+ on Linux
